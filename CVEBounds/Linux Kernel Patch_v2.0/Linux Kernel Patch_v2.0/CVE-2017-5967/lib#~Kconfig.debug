-	  If you say Y here, additional code will be inserted into the
-	  timer routines to collect statistics about kernel timers being
-	  reprogrammed. The statistics can be read from /proc/timer_stats.
-	  The statistics collection is started by writing 1 to /proc/timer_stats,
-	  writing 0 stops it. This feature is useful to collect information
-	  about timer usage patterns in kernel and userspace. This feature
-	  is lightweight if enabled in the kernel config but not activated
-	  (it defaults to deactivated on bootup and will only be activated
-	  if some application like powertop activates it explicitly).
