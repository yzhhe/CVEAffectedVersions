+ * pte_offset_map_lock on 32bit PAE kernels was reading the pmd_t with
+ * a "*pmdp" dereference done by gcc. Problem is, in certain places
+ * where pte_offset_map_lock is called, concurrent page faults are
+ * allowed, if the mmap_sem is hold for reading. An example is mincore
+ * vs page faults vs MADV_DONTNEED. On the page fault side
+ * pmd_populate rightfully does a set_64bit, but if we're reading the
+ * pmd_t with a "*pmdp" on the mincore side, a SMP race can happen
+ * because gcc will not read the 64bit of the pmd atomically. To fix
+ * this all places running pmd_offset_map_lock() while holding the
+ * mmap_sem in read mode, shall read the pmdp pointer using this
+ * function to know if the pmd is null nor not, and in turn to know if
+ * they can run pmd_offset_map_lock or pmd_trans_huge or other pmd
+ * operations.
+ *
+ * Without THP if the mmap_sem is hold for reading, the
+ * pmd can only transition from null to not null while pmd_read_atomic runs.
+ * So there's no need of literally reading it atomically.
+ *
+ * With THP if the mmap_sem is hold for reading, the pmd can become
+ * THP or null or point to a pte (and in turn become "stable") at any
+ * time under pmd_read_atomic, so it's mandatory to read it atomically
+ * with cmpxchg8b.
