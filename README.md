# Source-Code-Vulnerability-Detection-Based-on-Patches-and-Developer-Logs-Public

The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) maintained by the U.S. government has always been an important source of software security information, and security professionals rely on the NVD to track vulnerabilities, fix vulnerabilities and analyze security trends. Previous researchers have identified the problem that a lot of information in these databases is both inconsistent and incomplete, such that it misleads the security professionals and hamper the improvement of system security.

In this project, a vulnerability detection method combining patches and developer logs is proposed to improve the accuracy of source code vulnerability detection tools and the accuracy of NVD reporting vulnerability version sets.
